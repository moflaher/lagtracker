object files (define the properties of an object)
gridsetupdef.m
lagrangiandef.m
timetrackerdef.m

object initialization files
gridsetup.m
lagrangian.m
timetracker.m
settings.m


There are a few things that still need to be cleaned or made in to single files as their function is very similar.
main.m & main_turbine_box.m
multitrianglechecker.m & trianglechecker.m
findquick.m & newfindquick.m
